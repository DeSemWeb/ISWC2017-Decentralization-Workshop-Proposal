      <h2>Abstract</h2>
      <!-- 200 word summary of the workshop purpose -->
      <!-- CONTEXT: Why the need is so pressing or important     -->
      The Semantic Web is increasingly becoming a centralized story:
      we rely on large-scale server-side infrastructures
      to perform intense reasoning, data mining, and query execution.
      <!-- NEED: Why something needed to be done at all          -->
      Therefore, we urgently need research and engineering
      to bring back the “Web” in the Semantic Web,
      and to develop the intelligent clients (as opposed to intelligent servers)
      as sketched in the original Semantic Web vision.
      <!-- TASK: What was undertaken to address the need         -->
      The DoD2017 workshop purposely takes a radical perspective
      by focusing solely on decentralized and client-side applications,
      to counterbalance the centralized discourse of other tracks.
      While we recognize the value in all subfields of the Semantic Web,
      we see an urgent need to revalue the role of clients.
      <!-- OBJECT: What the present document does or covers      -->
      This proposal details the topics and motivation of the workshop,
      as well as the organisational aspects.
      <!-- FINDINGS: What the work done yielded or revealed      -->
      We believe this proposal will help
      put different topics on the Semantic Web community’s research agenda,
      <!-- CONCLUSION :What the findings mean for the audience   -->
      which should lead to new inspiration and initiatives
      <!-- PERSPECTIVES: What the future holds, beyond this work -->
      to build future Semantic Web and Linked Data applications.

      <h2>Motivation</h2>
      <!-- Why is the topic timely and of particular interest to ISWC participants?
           (One to three paragraphs) -->
       <p>
         Despite its decentralized architecture,
         the Web has become increasingly centralized the past couple of years.
         A large part of the Semantic Web community seems to follow this movement:
         only a minority of ISWC papers of last year focused on the “Web”
         aspect of the Semantic Web.
         While we agree that there is value in all of the aspects of the Semantic Web
         (databases, logic, reasoning, streams, services, …),
         this workshop aims to revalue “Web” as an important topic and,
         together with “Semantic”, as a major differentiator from other communities.
       </p>
       <p>
         Initiatives such as Linked Data traversal-based query evaluation
         and, recently, Linked Data Notifications,
         reveal the powerful combination of semantics and decentralization.
         Works focusing on in-browser code execution,
         such as client-side SPARQL query evaluation by Linked Data Fragments,
         leverage the significant CPU power every client brings
         to enhance the scalability of Semantic Web applications.
         However, much more research is needed to fully explore
         the opportunities semantic technologies bring to decentralization
         and vice-versa.
       </p>
       <p>
         Hence, this workshop is highly relevant for ISWC participants,
         and timely to help counterbalance the ongoing centralization.

    <section id="format">
      <h2>Format</h2>
      <!-- The intended mix of events, such as paper presentations,
           invited talks, panels, demos and general discussion
           (Either a tabular schedule or a one paragraph summary) -->
      <p>
        The workshop organizers will release a call for contributions,
        to which people can submit short articles, demos,
        and proposals for lightning talks.
        Accepted contributions will be presented at the workshop,
        together with one or two invited talks.
        We plan an interactive discussion session,
        in which invited speakers and members of the audience
        debate over pressing questions
        regarding the future of the (Semantic) Web
        and the role decentralization can play herein.

    <section id="audience">
      <h2>Audience</h2>
      <!-- Who and how many people are likely to attend?
           (One paragraph) -->
      <p>
        We expect to attract people interested in Linked Data consumption on the Web,
        drawing for instance from the popular but discontinued COLD workshop series.
        Also, people with a focus on a wide range of applications,
        with the Web as common denominator,
        are expected.
        Additionally, we hope to draw in new audience members
        from Web and decentralized communities.
        We aim for an audience of at least 20 people,
        but our ambition would be to reach between 30 and 40.

    <section id="community">
      <h2>Community</h2>
      <!-- Demonstrate that there is an existing community interested
           in the topic by providing references for up to six papers
           relating to the core topic of the workshop
           (conference, workshop, journal, etc., preferably not co-authored
           by the organisers and preferably published in the past few years).
           References may include papers from external communities
           whom the organisers hope to attract to ISWC.
           Otherwise, if six such papers cannot be provided,
           discuss why the workshop should still attract submissions.
