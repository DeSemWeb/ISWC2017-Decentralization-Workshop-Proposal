      <h2>Motivation</h2>
      <!-- Why is the topic timely and of particular interest to ISWC participants?
           (One to three paragraphs) -->
       <p>
         Despite its decentralized architecture,
         the Web has become increasingly centralized the past couple of years.
         A large part of the Semantic Web community seems to follow this movement:
         only a minority of ISWC papers of last year focused on the “Web”
         aspect of the Semantic Web.
         While we agree that there is value in all of the aspects of the Semantic Web
         (databases, logic, reasoning, streams, services, …),
         this workshop aims to revalue “Web” as an important topic and,
         together with “Semantic”, as a major differentiator from other communities.
       </p>
       <p>
         Initiatives such as Linked Data traversal-based query evaluation
         and, recently, Linked Data Notifications,
         reveal the powerful combination of semantics and decentralization.
         Works focusing on in-browser code execution,
         such as client-side SPARQL query evaluation by Linked Data Fragments,
         leverage the significant CPU power every client brings
         to enhance the scalability of Semantic Web applications.
         However, much more research is needed to fully explore
         the opportunities semantic technologies bring to decentralization
         and vice-versa.
       </p>
       <p>
         Hence, this workshop is highly relevant for ISWC participants,
         and timely to help counterbalance the ongoing centralization.

    <section id="community">
      <h2>Community</h2>
      <!-- Demonstrate that there is an existing community interested
           in the topic by providing references for up to six papers
           relating to the core topic of the workshop
           (conference, workshop, journal, etc., preferably not co-authored
           by the organisers and preferably published in the past few years).
           References may include papers from external communities
           whom the organisers hope to attract to ISWC.
           Otherwise, if six such papers cannot be provided,
           discuss why the workshop should still attract submissions.

        <p class="bio">
          Ruben Verborgh is a researcher in semantic hypermedia
          at Ghent University – imec, Belgium
          and a postdoctoral fellow of the Research Foundation Flanders.
          He explores the connection between Semantic Web technologies
          and the Web’s architectural properties,
          with the ultimate goal of building more intelligent clients.
          Along the way, he became fascinated by Linked Data,
          REST/hypermedia, Web APIs, and related technologies.
          He’s a co-author of two books on Linked Data,
          and has contributed to more than 200 publications
          for international conferences and journals on Web-related topics.
